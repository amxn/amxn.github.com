      <h1>Github - A Product Dissection.</h1>
      <div class="post">
        <h3>Github the product and the ecosystem:</h3>
        <p>
           Github, started it's journey as a community/tool to collaborate with fellow programmers. It helps with Project documentation, Issue tracking, Pull Requests, Code Reviews (with in-line comments), Single & Split Comparison Diffs. As a product, it was every developer's dream!
        </p>
        <h3>The Why?</h3>
        <p>
           It was a brand new collaborative experience and promoted sharing information/open-source and became a treasure trove of high-quality informative content. It did everything that a programmer needed to do and helped organize projects so much better. It was convergence done right, many products try to do multiple things and end up failing. It offered both enterprise and the independent developer a superior experience compared to any product/tool (paid or otherwise) did at that point in time.
        </p>
        <p>
           It changed quite a few industries, it’s impact rippled across and can be seen in many products. It promoted best practices such as Code Reviews which Indie Studios couldn't afford to spend time on, or simply weren't aware of. It changed how students turned in their homework and were graded, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
           Github is one of the products/services which ended up popularizing its underlying technology – Git and to a lesser degree – Markdown. It’s impact is invaluable and spawned a paradigm shift in how open-source projects had been organized and maintained (compared to the dark days of Sourceforge and Google code). Github actively encourages it’s users to contribute and helps determine which license to use (usually permissive ones).

           P.S. This post might be biased as it's hosted on Github Pages :)
