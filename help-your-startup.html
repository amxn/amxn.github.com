          Chennai is facing a crisis it hasn't faced in over a century, while the storm has passed
          we're still recoiling from it's effects. Many of you are probably reading this on your phone
          with spotty 3G/2G. Many offices are inaccessible due to water logging
          or due to fallen trees, or power and/or the internet hasn't been restored yet
          or in some heartening cases is hosting those that lost their homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many fledgling startups this is a critical period of your journey
          if you have customers, people from Chennai and those affected might understand,
          but it might not make business sense for others to pay for a service or an app
          that is down or broken.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm grateful that my locality isn't as severely struck as some others throughout
          the City. We've been blessed with stable power, and connectivity and access to other essentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a fellow dev and startup enthusiast I would like to help in any way possible
          to keep your businesses afloat. I'll provide pro-bono assistance to stabilize your
          service/product for nothing in return, as a Chennaiite it is within us to help
          each other out in the face of calamities <a class="annotation" href="#1">[1]</a>. No copyright, no plagiarism, etc.
          While signing an NDA might not be feasible, this is a post in good faith.
          I'll try to restore your apps and/or services to a serviceable condition.
          I'm confident about my ability (with your assistance ofcourse),
          and if I'm unable to do something I'll be forthcoming about it.
          No point in giving false hope. This is the least I can do in lieu of social service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to <a href="tel:988-405-5746">contact me</a> anytime throughout the day (& night).
